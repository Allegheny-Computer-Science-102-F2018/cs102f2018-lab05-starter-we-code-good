The purpose of this study was to show how gesture can enhance math performance. It was an
experimental research study that looked at how gesture effects childrenâ€™s learning of math, particularly
addition. The independent variable was gesture with three different conditions; gesture, no gesture,
and partial gesture. The dependent variable of the study was the difference between pre- and post- test
scores on a math task. The mediator variable was the speech being used during the lesson.
