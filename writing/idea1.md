Please be sure that you justify why your idea is of interest to discrete structures.



### Idea 1(John Scott)

1) **Explain your idea for a class project.**
A sentiment analysis tool for different keywords or hashtags on Twitter. Twitter's
advanced search allows users to find results based on specific word or date ranges,
so this tool could be used to see how people feel about different topics over time.
This could be used to review product reception, or to gauge public political opinions.

2) **How is the idea connected to computer science?**
Sentiment analysis is a popular field of computer science. This would be the core
of the project, along with the Twitter API being used to collect data.

3) **What is the article's reference to support this idea? Note: Articles are no older than five years**
[Sentiment Analysis of Twitter Data: A Survey of Techniques](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1601.06971.pdf)

4) **What is the central thesis to the article?**
This article is an outline of the existing techniques for sentiment analysis, as
well as surveys showing which methods are more effective and accurate. There is no
specific project outlined, but rather a base to start sentiment analysis from.

5) **How will this article support your idea?**
Since the article is a survey showing the current state of sentiment analysis on
Twitter, the article eliminates many questions and unknowns in beginning a project
that uses the technique. Hence, much of the early "dirty work" has already been done
in this paper.
