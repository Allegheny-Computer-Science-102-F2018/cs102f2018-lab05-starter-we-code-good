## Proposal:

Our team's motivation for this project is that we wanted to utilize our backgrounds
in computer science and music to create something that could benefit both communities by developing something with our knowledge of music. We believe that by creating
this software for our final project that we can open the door for other computer science and music related projects, hopefully bringing more attention to the combination of these two fields. This is represented by our use of the python programming language and the music theory background that fugues are based on to create this multi-focused final project. This will eventually also include the components needed to take in CSV input files and graphs for our music generator to create our expected output. We intend to use one of python's many music libraries
to hopefully mimic the abilities of the java music library, JFugue, to get the same thing done.

After discussing the feasibility of our ideas with the teaching assistants and
the instructor, our team has decided to proceed with our idea for a music
generator. This music generator will utilize specific algorithms to write parts for different voices using a single theme and are based on a specific mathematical
structure. We would also like to expand upon this idea making this music generator
eventually take some form of input either text from an article or taking in data
points from a graph to give a user the ability to hear what kind of inflection
is being used or if there are rises and falls in the data. This addition to a
basic program or idea will open new opportunities for the blind because now they
will be able to understand what is occurring in a plot of data or in an article
through the changes and the emotions.

Expanding on the feasibility of our project, we have a few options when addressing feasibility within the scope of our class. First, if we find we are running short on time, we can simply end our project after we implement the necessary algorithms and packages to generate fuegues. If we still have some additional time but not enough to fully implement an approach to generating music from real-world inputs, we can still research and do some testing on the subject and add this to our future work/conclusion section of our paper. Ideally, we will be able to finish all of this project without a problem (as described in our first paragraph). Lastly, our sources are below, one source contains useful algorithms for our project, while the other focuses on generating music from real world inputs.
