For each of your five ideas, please respond to the following. Each person is to submit a markdown document containing the names of his or her group members.

Please be sure that you justify why your idea is of interest to discrete structures.



### Idea 1(John Scott

1) **Explain your idea for a class project.**
A sentiment analysis tool for different keywords or hashtags on Twitter. Twitter's
advanced search allows users to find results based on specific word or date ranges,
so this tool could be used to see how people feel about different topics over time.
This could be used to review product reception, or to gauge public political opinions.

2) **How is the idea connected to computer science?**
Sentiment analysis is a popular field of computer science. This would be the core
of the project, along with the Twitter API being used to collect data.

3) **What is the article's reference to support this idea? Note: Articles are no older than five years**

[Sentiment Analysis of Twitter Data: A Survey of Techniques](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1601.06971.pdf)

4) **What is the central thesis to the article?**
This article is an outline of the existing techniques for sentiment analysis, as
well as surveys showing which methods are more effective and accurate. There is no
specific project outlined, but rather a base to start sentiment analysis from.

5) **How will this article support your idea?**
Since the article is a survey showing the current state of sentiment analysis on
Twitter, the article eliminates many questions and unknowns in beginning a project
that uses the technique. Hence, much of the early "dirty work" has already been done
in this paper.


### Idea 2(Jonathan Mendez)

1. **Explain your idea for a class project.**
A music generator that uses algorithms to write parts for different voices and
meters. For example, fugues, which are just different uses of a single theme,
are based on a specific mathematic structure.

2. **How is the idea connected to computer science?**
It is connected directly to computer science because we would need to take the
algorithms that fugues are founded on and directly code them into python,
hopefully producing a decent sounding output.

3. **What is the article's reference to support this idea? Note: Articles are no older than five years**
[Computational Fugue Analysis](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01113520/document)

4. **What is the central thesis to the article?**
According to the article, they utilized an analysis tool, which ran a series of
developed algorithms, to test the fugues design.

5. **How will this article support your idea?**
This article helps support this idea because the only difference is that the
algorithms they used would be repurposed to generate parts based off of elements
they are currently analyzing.

### Idea 3(Matt Jones)


**1) Explain your idea for a class project.**
Use research done in detecting beats and drum patterns in polyphonic music from their .wav files. Because rhythm and percussion is the backbone of any polyphonic group, we are interested in focusing specifically on this to group similar music together.

**2) How is the idea connected to computer science?**
Already many algorithms and formulas for reading .wav files and grouping similar music (music suggestion programs, etc.). It's related to discrete structures because it's using mathmatical formulas in python to interpret these .wav files.

**3) What is the article's reference to support this idea? Note: Articles are no older than five years**
The articles listed below have built the systems to recognize patterns in beat/tempo and percussive patterns (older):

[supporting article](http://winnie.kuis.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~yoshii/papers/mirex-2005-yoshii.pdf) The next article is newer than the previous two, and also goes on to identify artists and songs by their percussive patterns. Using this, we can take artists we already know people percieve as similar, and compare their percussive patterns.[Article3](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13636-014-0026-5)

**4) What is the central thesis to the article(s)?**
How accuratly you can find the tempo/rhythm and percussive patterns in different genres (changes how difficult it is to pick up on the patterns)? And, how to separate percussive and harmonic sounds from monaural non-vocal polyphonic signals.

**5) How will this article support your idea?**
Build our system directly off of their systems and add the portiion that groups music with similarities together.

### Idea 4(Carson Quigley)

1. **Explain your idea for a class project.**  
A bare-bones compiler/interpreter formatted in a game-like sense that accepts a
file as input and hopefully provides a number of case-by-case solutions to common
python errors.

2. **How is the idea connected to computer science?**  
It is directly tied to code compilation and attampts to allow users to 'teach themselves'
by participating in a code-like game.

3. **What is the article's reference to support this idea? Note: Articles are no older than five years**  
_Learning by Taking Apart: Deconstructing Code by Reading, Tracing, and Debugging_
is the title of the piece, need I say more?

4. **What is the central thesis to the article?**  
"This paper argues that several lines of research support the premise that people
who are learning to write code to spec can learn more efficiently if deconstructionist
activities (reading, tracing, and debugging) are incorporated in the learning process."
--Quoted from Griffin, P. 151.

5. **How will this article support your idea?**  
This article doesn't simply support the idea, but provides a baseline of research
on the background proposing that the style of learning propogated by the proposed
project. In short, the article provides a peer-reviewed and researched background
as to _why_ we would pursue a project such as this.

### Idea 5(Carson Quigley)

1. **Explain your idea for a class project.**  
Create a robust and self-stabilizing program that can handle any kind of input.  

2. **How is the idea connected to computer science?**  
It helps keep programs fault-tolerant.  

3. **What is the article's reference to support this idea? Note: Articles are no older than five years**  
The article is titled _Designing Self-Stabilizing Systems Using Game Theory_, 2016.

4. **What is the central thesis to the article?**  
Using game theory, they were able to come up with algorithms that allow systems to 
self-stabilize in the face of many arbitrary system faults.  

5. **How will this article support your idea?**  
The article provides a background on the idea behind self-stabilizing systems that 
would help in creating our own fault-tolerant programs.
