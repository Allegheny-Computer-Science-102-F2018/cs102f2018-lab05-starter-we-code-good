For each of your five ideas, please respond to the following. Each person is to submit a markdown document containing the names of his or her group members.

Please be sure that you justify why your idea is of interest to discrete structures.



### Idea 1(John Scott

1) **Explain your idea for a class project.**
A sentiment analysis tool for different keywords or hashtags on Twitter. Twitter's
advanced search allows users to find results based on specific word or date ranges,
so this tool could be used to see how people feel about different topics over time.
This could be used to review product reception, or to gauge public political opinions.

2) **How is the idea connected to computer science?**
Sentiment analysis is a popular field of computer science. This would be the core
of the project, along with the Twitter API being used to collect data.

3) **What is the article's reference to support this idea? Note: Articles are no older than five years**

[Sentiment Analysis of Twitter Data: A Survey of Techniques](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1601.06971.pdf)

4) **What is the central thesis to the article?**
This article is an outline of the existing techniques for sentiment analysis, as
well as surveys showing which methods are more effective and accurate. There is no
specific project outlined, but rather a base to start sentiment analysis from.

5) **How will this article support your idea?**
Since the article is a survey showing the current state of sentiment analysis on
Twitter, the article eliminates many questions and unknowns in beginning a project
that uses the technique. Hence, much of the early "dirty work" has already been done
in this paper.


### Idea 2(Jonathan Mendez)

1. **Explain your idea for a class project.**
A music generator that uses algorithms to write parts for different voices and
meters. For example, fugues, which are just different uses of a single theme,
are based on a specific mathematic structure.

2. **How is the idea connected to computer science?**
It is connected directly to computer science because we would need to take the
algorithms that fugues are founded on and directly code them into python,
hopefully producing a decent sounding output.

3. **What is the article's reference to support this idea? Note: Articles are no older than five years**
[Computational Fugue Analysis](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01113520/document)

4. **What is the central thesis to the article?**
According to the article, they utilized an analysis tool, which ran a series of
developed algorithms, to test the fugues design.

5. **How will this article support your idea?**
This article helps support this idea because the only difference is that the
algorithms they used would be repurposed to generate parts based off of elements
they are currently analyzing.

### Idea 3(Matt Jones)

1) Explain your idea for a class project.

2) How is the idea connected to computer science?

3) What is the article's reference to support this idea? Note: Articles are no older than five years

4) What is the central thesis to the article?

5) How will this article support your idea?

### Idea 4(Carson Quigley)

1. **Explain your idea for a class project.**  
A bare-bones compiler/interpreter formatted in a game-like sense that accepts a
file as input and hopefully provides a number of case-by-case solutions to common
python errors.

2. **How is the idea connected to computer science?**  
It is directly tied to code compilation and attampts to allow users to 'teach themselves'
by participating in a code-like game.

3. **What is the article's reference to support this idea? Note: Articles are no older than five years**  
_Learning by Taking Apart: Deconstructing Code by Reading, Tracing, and Debugging_
is the title of the piece, need I say more?

4. **What is the central thesis to the article?**  
"This paper argues that several lines of research support the premise that people
who are learning to write code to spec can learn more efficiently if deconstructionist
activities (reading, tracing, and debugging) are incorporated in the learning process."
--Quoted from Griffin, P. 151.

5. **How will this article support your idea?**  
This article doesn't simply support the idea, but provides a baseline of research
on the background proposing that the style of learning propogated by the proposed
project. In short, the article provides a peer-reviewed and researched background
as to _why_ we would pursue a project such as this.
