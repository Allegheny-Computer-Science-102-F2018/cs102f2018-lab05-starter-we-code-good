For each of your five ideas, please respond to the following. Each person is to submit a markdown document containing the names of his or her group members.

Please be sure that you justify why your idea is of interest to discrete structures.

### Idea 2(Jonathan Mendez)

1. **Explain your idea for a class project.**

A music generator that uses algorithms to write parts for different voices and
meters. For example, fugues, which are just different uses of a single theme,
are based on a specific mathematic structure.

2. **How is the idea connected to computer science?**

It is connected directly to computer science because we would need to take the
algorithms that fugues are founded on and directly code them into python,
hopefully producing a decent sounding output.

3. **What is the article's reference to support this idea? Note: Articles are no older than five years**
[Computational Fugue Analysis](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01113520/document)

4. **What is the central thesis to the article?**

According to the article, they utilized an analysis tool, which ran a series of
developed algorithms, to test the fugues design.

5. **How will this article support your idea?**

This article helps support this idea because the only difference is that the
algorithms they used would be repurposed to generate parts based off of elements
they are currently analyzing.
