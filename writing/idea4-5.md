For each of your five ideas, please respond to the following. Each person is to 
submit a markdown document containing the names of his or her group members.

Please be sure that you justify why your idea is of interest to discrete structures.

### Idea 4(Carson Quigley)

1. **Explain your idea for a class project.**  
A bare-bones compiler/interpreter formatted in a game-like sense that accepts a 
file as input and hopefully provides a number of case-by-case solutions to common 
python errors. This isn't intended to be an actual compiler/interpreter, but rather 
serves as a sneaky teaching tool that allows players to learn through interest.

2. **How is the idea connected to computer science?**  
It is directly tied to code compilation and attampts to allow users to 'teach 
themselves' by participating in a code-like game

3. **What is the article's reference to support this idea? Note: Articles are no 
older than five years**  
_Learning by Taking Apart: Deconstructing Code by Reading, Tracing, and Debugging_ 
is the title of the piece, need I say more?

4. **What is the central thesis to the article?**  
"This paper argues that several lines of research support the premise that people 
who are learning to write code to spec can learn more efficiently if deconstructionist 
activities (reading, tracing, and debugging) are incorporated in the learning process." 
--Quoted from Griffin, P. 151.

5. **How will this article support your idea?**  
This article doesn't simply support the idea, but provides a baseline of research 
on the background proposing that the style of learning propogated by the proposed 
project. In short, the article provides a peer-reviewed and researched background 
as to _why_ we would pursue a project such as this.

### Idea 5(Carson Quigley)

1. **Explain your idea for a class project.**  
Create a robust and self-stabilizing program that can handle any kind of input.  

2. **How is the idea connected to computer science?**  
It helps keep programs fault-tolerant.  

3. **What is the article's reference to support this idea? Note: Articles are no older than five years**  
The article is titled _Designing Self-Stabilizing Systems Using Game Theory_, 2016.

4. **What is the central thesis to the article?**  
Using game theory, they were able to come up with algorithms that allow systems to 
self-stabilize in the face of many arbitrary system faults.  

5. **How will this article support your idea?**  
The article provides a background on the idea behind self-stabilizing systems that 
would help in creating our own fault-tolerant programs.
